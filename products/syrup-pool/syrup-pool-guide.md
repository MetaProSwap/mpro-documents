# How to Stake in Pools

Staking in Pools lets you earn MPRO or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with MetaProSwap Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually MPRO.

## **Getting started with Syrup Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page.

2\. Connect to your BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Connect Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Pool you want to stake in.

**Manual MPRO** doesn’t automatically compound. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Pools let you stake your MPRO to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.\\

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to \*\*"\*\*Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Pool. The pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing MPRO from a pool** \*\*\*\*

You can easily add more MPRO to a Pool, or move some MPRO to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked MPRO.

1\. Click the **-** to take some MPRO out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

3\. Click **Confirm**.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
